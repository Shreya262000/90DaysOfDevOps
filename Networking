Day 1: Networking Fundamentals + Security - #90DaysOfDevOps2025 🚀

Introduction
Welcome to **Day 1** of my **#90DaysOfDevOps** journey! Today, I focused on **Networking Fundamentals**, a critical skill for DevOps engineers. Understanding networking helps manage cloud environments, troubleshoot issues, and ensure secure communication between services.

🌐 **Networking Basics**
OSI & TCP/IP Models
Networking follows structured communication models:

- **OSI Model (7 Layers):** Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical.
- **TCP/IP Model (4 Layers):** Application, Transport, Internet, Network Interface.

IP Addressing & Subnetting
- **IPv4 & IPv6** – Unique device identifiers.
- **Subnetting** – Dividing networks for efficiency.
- **CIDR Notation** – Defines network ranges (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).

Common Networking Concepts
- **DNS** – Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
- **DHCP** – Dynamically assigns IP addresses.
- **Ports & Protocols** – Defines communication rules (e.g., HTTP: `80`, HTTPS: `443`).

🔒 **Networking Security**
Security is crucial in DevOps:

- **Firewalls & Security Groups** – Controls traffic flow.
- **VPN & Encryption** – Secures remote access and data.
- **IAM & Zero Trust** – Manages user permissions and authentication.

🛠 **Hands-on Practice**
- ✅ Used `ping` & `traceroute` to analyze network paths.
- ✅ Checked open ports with `netstat`.
- ✅ Configured AWS Security Groups.
- ✅ Set up an Nginx web server.

🚀 **Key Takeaways**
✔️ Networking is the **backbone** of DevOps.  
✔️ Security ensures safe communication.  
✔️ Next Up: Linux & Shell Scripting! 🐧
